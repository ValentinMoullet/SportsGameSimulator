Eval methods

- use cases scenarios
- examination of scores (poisson distribution and compare with bookmakers)
- show overall distribution of events (plots already one)
- tables of translation probabilities (corner -> goal, penalty, offside, ...) real and predicted
- give first 45 min of game, and output rest and compare without giving correct first 45 min
